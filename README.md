In this project, we created a forecasting random forest decision tree ensemble that is able to predict the probability of an earthquake happening given a location, time, and magnitude

All dependencies are included in the virtual environment '.venv', and so to be able to run this code all you have to do is download all of files within this project, activate the virtual environment using 
'.venv/bin/activate', and then train the model by running the program.
