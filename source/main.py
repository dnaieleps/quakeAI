# clean the .csv file on earthquake data found in the resources folder (pandas)


# turn cleaned file into np.array to be passed into the input layer of model (numpy + pandas)


# create the model architecture to be able for prediction forecasting  (tensorflow / pytorch)
# **research has shown that random forest is best for predicting WHEN, and LSTM is best for predicting magnitude


# train the model given the specific architecture (tensorflow, sklearn)


# do error analysis and construct graphs of training loss, cv loss, test loss, epochs, etc. (matplotlib + sklearn)


# predict (tensorflow)
